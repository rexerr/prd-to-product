# Retro — 2026-06-20 22:52 CDT — Context-lifecycle port to `context-engineering` (Slice A)   (5th session of the day)

Ports the [D-048](../DECISIONS.md) lifecycle shape into the skill. Decision: [D-049](../DECISIONS.md). Plan: `~/.claude/plans/gleaming-giggling-wozniak.md`. Built but **not pushed** as of writing.

## What was completed

- **Stale-retro correction (session open).** The 4th-session retro ([`2026-06-20-context-lifecycle-dogfood-built.md`](2026-06-20-context-lifecycle-dogfood-built.md)) was committed at `5a9b545`, then `5ba52ec` landed 6 min later — so its "retirement ritual UNEXERCISED" claim froze before the session's last work. Rex caught that I'd repeated the stale claim at session-start. Appended a post-retro correction + committed (`4d04b26`).
- **D-049 lifecycle port, Slice A (Option 3 — born graduation-aware).** Authored via `/furnace-plan`, blind `Explore` reviewer + Cowork `/plan-review` ×2. Shipped: the retirement ritual (pre/post-graduation, untracked-ticket `git mv` fallback, +1-`../` link-depth rewrite, thin-on-touch) into `end-session.md.template`; a **concrete** graduation rule (names `BACKLOG.md` + read-cap trigger, not the abstract D-048 meta-pattern) into `claude-rules-flat-AGENTS.md.template` + `claude-rules-modular/session-discipline.md.template`; a `BACKLOG.md.template` Conventions pointer; a `generator/decisions.md` "graduation-emitted, not generator-written" note; `NOTES.md` ref; fixture regen (`output-small` AGENTS.md + BACKLOG.md + end-session.md, in the fixture's condensed style); D-049 logged + mirrored + marker bumped.
- **Verified:** red/green grep — the concrete phrase "split it into a thin one-line-per-item index" is present in both the prose templates and the bulleted fixture; the `docs/tickets/archive/` ritual is in all expected files; no stray markers in fixtures; diff is 37 insertions across 11 files (well under the 300 cap).

## Trial data (the experiment Rex asked for)

- **First live cc-subagent rows on a plan I authored this session** — 4 `cc-subagent` rows + 5 `cowork` rows (R1×4, R2×1) in `trial-ledger.md`, all dated 2026-06-21 UTC. The end-to-end loop (blind subagent → `## Subagent review log` → Cowork transcribes) fired on a real, self-authored furnace plan — the furnace-trial ticket's open item.
- **Taint signal (answers Rex's "playing telephone" worry): low anchoring.** Cowork reviewed the *twice-baked* plan — it could see the cc-subagent's log — and still caught a **Must-fix the blind subagent missed** (the fixture omitted `output-small/AGENTS.md`, so the plan's own red/green check couldn't pass). The oracle found new, deeper ground rather than rubber-stamping the subagent's list. This is the division of labor the trial predicts; it argues *against* the "subagent should write the ledger directly" change (D-043 stands).

## Failure this session

- **Tag: lost context (near-miss, caught by Rex).** At session-start I relayed the prior retro's end-state verbatim without reconciling it against `git log` — the `/session-start` command literally tells me to cross-check git history, and the `5ba52ec`-after-retro ordering was right there. Rex caught it. **Generalizes?** It's the "a retro is a snapshot that can freeze before the session's last commits" class. Fix applied: corrected the stale retro so the next session doesn't inherit it. No new rule (n=1; the cross-check step already exists — I just didn't execute it).
- **cc-subagent missed the fixture-AGENTS.md Must-fix** — but this is the expected bucket-2 division of labor (a fresh blind read of the plan, not the repo's fixture topology), exactly what Cowork is load-bearing for. Not a process failure; logged as trial signal above.

## Files changed

11 files (Slice A product + D-049) in one commit; `trial-ledger.md` swept separately (Cowork's measurement append, D-018 carve-out). See the two commits.

## Open items

- **Slice B deferred** (own pass if/when wanted): the richer `templates/docs/tickets/README.md.template` source content + any dedicated runtime graduation-emission wiring. The `/end-session` ritual already carries a self-contained convention, so Slice B is a nicety, not a blocker.
- **Not pushed** — awaiting Rex's go.
- **Calibration read (Cowork-on-raw) effectively moot** now the plan is built; the original-flow read already gave the taint signal. Raw plan still in context if the trial wants the formal divergence number.
- **Modular half has no fixture** — the session-discipline graduation block is self-verified by ad-hoc dry-run; closing it needs an `examples/output-modular/` tree (a standing BACKLOG item).

## Next session

- Push Slice A when Rex says go; consider Slice B; or pick up the next rock.
